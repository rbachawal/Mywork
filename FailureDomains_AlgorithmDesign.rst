Introduction
============

Motr uses a parity declustered layout which stripes a file over
devices/targets in such a way that failure of any :math:`K` devices,
among available :math:`P` devices, is tolerable. We aim to extend this
fault tolerance to failure domains other than a device (ie. controller,
enclosure, rack).

Problem definition
==================

We represent a pool as a tree, with each level representing one failure
domain. Starting from the virtual root node “Pool”, we get racks,
enclosures, controllers, and devices at subsequent levels of this tree.
[1] This hierarchy of failure domains can be, if desirable, refined to
include drawers, midplanes, *etc*. Inclusion of new failure domain types
won’t affect the design materially.

Consider Fig 1.0 representing a tree of failure domains. Assume that
each parity group has :math:`N` data units, :math:`K` parity units, and
:math:`S` spare units. Our aim is to distribute the total :math:`G = N + K + S` units across a pool, such that user
supplied tolerance for each level of tree is satisfied. Following
definitions are useful for exploring the solution.

**Def:** *Tolerance vector* associated with a failure domains tree (FDT)
of height :math:`h` is a vector of size :math:`h`, :math:`i` :sup:`th` member of which represents the required tolerance associated with
:math:`i` :sup:`th` level of the FDT.

For the given values of :math:`N`, :math:`K` and :math:`S` all tolerance
vectors associated with an FDT need not be feasible.

**Def:** For the given values of :math:`N`, :math:`K` and :math:`S` we
represent the set of feasible tolerance vectors by
:math:`F`:sub:`v` :math:`(N + S, K)`.

**Def**: An FDT is symmetric if all nodes at the same level have same
number of children.

**Def:** An FDT that is not symmetric is asymmetric.

**Def:** A partition of a positive integer :math:`n`, also called an
integer partition, is a way of writing :math:`n` as a sum of positive
integers [3].

**Def:** Two partitions that differ only in order of their summands are
considered equivalent.

**Def:** For a given number :math:`n` a set of all partitions of
:math:`l` parts is denoted by :math:`\text{Part}(n,\ l)`.

**Def:** A partition :math:`d\  \in \text{Part}(n,\ l)` is called
*uniform* if every summand
:math:`s \in \{\text{floor}(\frac{n}{l}),\ \text{ceil}(\frac{n}{l})\}`.

**Note:** A uniform distribution can be generated by dividing :math:`n`
equally (to integer limit) into :math:`l` parts, and distribute the
remainder :math:`r\  = \ n\ \%\ l` , into any of the :math:`r` from
:math:`l\ `\ parts.

**Def:** A set of uniform partitions is denoted by
:math:`\text{UPart}(n,\ l)`.

**Def:** A partition that is not uniform is called a *skewed* partition.

**Def:** A two-tuple :math:`(N,\ L)` defines a *constraint over a
partition* :math:`d` from :math:`d\  \in \text{Part}(n,\ l)` if
:math:`N\  < \ n` and :math:`L\  < \ l`.

**Def:** A partition :math:`d_{}` is said to satisfy a constraint
:math:`(N,\ L)` if it does not have any :math:`L` sized subset, sum of
whose elements exceeds :math:`N`.

.. _section-1:

Properties of uniform partition
===============================

**Claim 1:** If a partition :math:`{d\  \in \text{Part}(n,\ l)}_{}` does
not satisfy a constraint :math:`(N,\ L)`, then none of its equivalent
partitions would satisfy the constraint.

**Proof:** Obvious.

**Claim 2:** Let :math:`d_{s}` represent an equivalent partition of
:math:`d_{}^{}`, summands of which are arranged in descending order.
Then if :math:`u\  \in \text{UPart}(n,\ l)` and
:math:`v\  \in \text{Part}(n,\ l)\ \backslash\ \text{Up}\text{art}(n,\ l)`,
then-

:math:`\sum_{j\  = \ 0}^{i}{}u_{s}\lbrack\ j\rbrack\  \leq \ \sum_{j\  = \ 0}^{i}{}v_{s}\lbrack\ j\ \rbrack`
, for any :math:`0\  \leq i < l`.

ie. for any arbitrary :math:`0\  \leq i < l`, sum of first :math:`i`
elements of :math:`u_{s}` is always less than or equal to that of
:math:`v_{s}`.

**Proof:**

Let :math:`q\ \  = \ \text{floor}(n/l)` and :math:`r\  = \ n\ \%\ l`.
For a uniform partition exactly :math:`r` elements will have value
:math:`q\  + \ 1` and remaining elements will hold value :math:`q`.

1. Suppose assertion of the claim is false and hence there exists some
   :math:`i'` such that:
   :math:`\sum_{j\  = \ 0}^{i'}{}u_{s}\lbrack\ j\ \rbrack\  > \ \sum_{j\  = \ 0}^{i'}{}v_{s}\lbrack\ j\ \rbrack`.

2. if :math:`u_{s}\lbrack i'\rbrack\ \  > \ v_{s}\lbrack i'\rbrack`

   a. If :math:`u_{s}\lbrack i'\rbrack\ \  = \ q`, then
      :math:`u_{s}\lbrack i\rbrack\ \  > v_{s}\lbrack i\rbrack,\ \text{for}\ i'\  < i\  < \ l\ `\ as
      all further elements from :math:`u_{s}\ `\ have value :math:`q`.

   b. If :math:`u_{s}\lbrack i'\rbrack\ \  = \ q\  + \ 1`, then
      :math:`u_{s}\lbrack i\rbrack\ \  \geq v_{s}\lbrack i\rbrack,\ \text{for}\ i'\  < i\  < \ l\ `,
      as :math:`u_{s}\lbrack i\rbrack\  \in \{ q,\ q\  + \ 1\}`

   c. In both the cases above sum of elements in skewed distribution
      will be less than that of uniform distribution, which is a
      contradiction.

3. if :math:`u_{s}\lbrack i'\rbrack\  \leq v_{s}\lbrack i'\rbrack`

   a. This implies
      :math:`v_{s}\lbrack j\rbrack\  \geq u_{s}\lbrack j\rbrack,\ \text{for}\ 0\  \leq j\  \leq i'\ `,
      as :math:`u_{s}\lbrack j\rbrack\  \in \{ q,\ q\  + \ 1\}` and
      :math:`v_{s}\ `\ is a sorted list. This contradicts (1) above.

**Property 1:** If a uniform partition
:math:`u\  \in \text{UPart}(n,\ l)` does not satisfy a constraint
:math:`(N,\ L)`, then no skewed partition :math:`v` can satisfy the
constraint.

**Proof:**

Claim 1 allows us to consider :math:`u_{s}` and :math:`v_{s}` instead of
:math:`u` and :math:`v`. By Claim 2 we have :

:math:`\sum_{i = 0}^{L_{}}{}u_{s}\lbrack i\rbrack\  \leq \ \sum_{i = 0}^{L}{}v_{s}\lbrack i\rbrack`

Since it is given that
:math:`N\  < \ \sum_{i = 0}^{L}{}u_{s}\lbrack i\rbrack\ `, a skewed
partition can not satisfy the given constraint.

**Property 2:** If :math:`u\  \in \text{UPart}(n,\ l)` and
:math:`v\  \in \ \text{Part}(n,\ l)\ \backslash\text{less}\ \text{UPart}(n,\ l)`,
then a maximum value from :math:`u` is less than or equal to maximum
value in :math:`v`. Formally,

   :math:`\max_{n_{i}\  \in \ v}\ n_{i}\  \geq \ \max_{n_{j}\  \in u}\ n_{j}\ `.

**Proof:**

Follows immediately from Property 1, when :math:`L` is set to :math:`1`.

Partition for symmetric FDT
===========================

Consider a symmetric FDT. If each node of tree distributes units
received from its parent uniformly among its children, then we achieve
the best possible tolerance with given parameters. This is so because if
a node distributes incoming units in skewed manner, then by Property 2
of uniform partition, the maximum value within its children (and hence
across the entire level of children) will increase. This might affect
the tolerance of entire level of children. Uniform partition helps
finding bounds on tolerance for each level. eg. If in a symmetric FDT we
have :math:`R` racks, :math:`E` enclosure within each rack, :math:`C`
controllers within each enclosure, and input parity group has
:math:`G\  = \ N\  + \ S\  + \ K`\ units, then:

:math:`{\text{\ \ }K}_{R}\  \leq \ \frac{K}{\text{ceil}\left( \frac{G}{R} \right)\text{\ \ }}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }(B_{1})`

:math:`\text{\ \ }K_{E}\  \leq \ \frac{K}{\text{ceil}\left( \frac{1}{E}\text{ceil}\left( \frac{G}{R} \right)\text{\ \ } \right)\text{\ \ }}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }(B_{2})`

In general if we have a symmetric tree with number of children a node at
level :math:`l` has are :math:`c_{l}`, then for a given level :math:`L`
we have:

:math:`K_{L}\  \leq \frac{K}{\text{ceil}\left( \frac{1}{c_{L}}\ \text{ceil}\ \left( \frac{1}{c_{L - 1}}\text{ceil}\left( \text{...}\frac{1}{c_{2}\ }\text{ceil}\left( \frac{G}{c_{1}} \right) \right) \right) \right)\ }\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }(B)`

.. _section-2:

Partition for asymmetric FDT
============================

Unlike symmetric FDT, uniform partition need not be a feasible in the
case of asymmetric FDT. For example in Fig 1.0, suppose each enclosure
in rack :math:`r_{0}` has two controllers except the enclosure
:math:`e_{0}`, which has one controller. If each enclosure receives
:math:`q` number of units (as a result of uniform distribution at the
level of racks), then all controllers except that of :math:`e_{0}` will
receive :math:`\frac{q}{2}` units from a parity group. Such an imbalance
might not guarantee the tolerance of :math:`K_{C}` associated with
controllers. This will require redistributing some of the units from
:math:`e_{0}` to other enclosures (from same or other racks) leading to
a skewed partition at the level of enclosures (and possibly at the level
of racks). The another problem this issue causes is inability to pick an
equivalent partition at a given level. Since all equivalent partitions
need not be supported at the level of a skewed element (element causing
asymmetry in FDT), a load imbalance gets introduced.

In order to address this issue, we factor out a virtual symmetric tree
off a given asymmetric tree. The degree of each node at any level in
virtual tree is same as the degree of a least degree node at the same
level in the input asymmetric tree. Following example demonstrates the
case. In the example from Fig. 3 we assume that from enclosure level
onwards, the tree is symmetric. The virtual tree that we construct out
of this tree will have two racks each having only single enclosure.

The fault-tolerant permutation is generated on this virtual tree. All
input tolerance parameters (ie. :math:`K_{R},\ K_{E},\ K_{C},` and
:math:`K_{T}`) are evaluated against the virtual tree. It can be noted
that a virtual tree formed in this manner will cause enclosure
e\ :sub:`0` to get filled before other enclosures. This is so because it
will be part of both possible virtual trees, whereas other enclosures
are part of only a single virtual tree. We address this issue in a
pragmatic way. We exclude those levels from FDT for which tolerance
cannot be satisfied. This helps in reducing asymmetries to some extend.
Eg, suppose :math:`N\  + \ S\  = 8`, :math:`K\  = \ 2`, and suppose each
enclosure has two controllers in Fig. 3, then in a virtual tree from
example in Fig, 3 the tolerance can never be satisfied at the level of
racks and enclosures. If we eliminate rack, and enclosures (i.e., let
:math:`K_{R}\  = \ 0,\ K_{E}\  = \ 0`), then we can distribute units
uniformly at the level of controllers. Since all controllers will get
populated uniformly the pool won’t be left with any holes in the end.

 Mapping asymmetric tree to virtual symmetric tree
-------------------------------------------------

The root will be identical in both trees. Let node :math:`n_{}`\ be a
member of both symmetric as well as asymmetric tree. Let degree of
:math:`n` in asymmetric tree be :math:`d_{A}(n)` and that in symmetric
tree be\ :math:`d_{S}(n)`. For creating a mapping between children of
:math:`n` in both the trees, we create a random permutation of its
:math:`d_{A}(n)\  - \ 1` children and pick the first
:math:`d_{S}(n)\  - \ 1` of them. The randomized permutation will be
generated using the *tile-id*\  [1]_, and *gfid* associated with the
file. Fig. 4 depicts the mapping scheme in detail.

Parity-group to target mapping
------------------------------

The procedure here runs in two steps:

-  Map an input (parity_group, unit) using fault-tolerant permutation
   present in pool-version, to appropriate location in the virtual tile.

-  Map the virtual symmetric tree to the physical tree using the scheme
   discussed in the previous sub-section.

.. _section-3:

Target-frame to parity group mapping
------------------------------------

If index of a target, and index of a frame on it is given then following
steps lead to the relevant parity-group and unit.

-  Calculate index of tile using the formula: tile_id = frame_index /
   tile->rows_nr.

-  Apply inverse of mappings between real tree and virtual tree, at each
   level of tree, starting from the eldest ancestor of given target, to
   get column index within a tile. This locates the target and frame in
   the fault-tolerant permutation.

-  Apply inverse of the fault-tolerant permutation and get the parity
   group and source associated with the frame.

tree to real tree. The skeleton tile contains P targets whereas the real
tree contains R >= P targets. For each target in skeleton tile, a random
permutation maps the ancestors of the target from skeleton tree to real
tree. The figure depicts how the target t\ 1 form the skeleton tree gets
mapped to the target t\ d from the real tree, after applying a sequence
of random permutations at each level of ancestors of t\ 1. Please note
that a target is a logical representation of device private to a file,
and hence all files share mutually exclusive target space [2].**

Characterizing the region of tolerable failures
===============================================

Throughout the document, when we say that a level :math:`l` has a
tolerance of :math:`K_{l}`, it implicitly indicates that
:math:`K_{l}\  + \ 1` failures at level :math:`l` would cause more than
:math:`K` failures in some parity group. Thus if level :math:`1` has
:math:`K_{1}` failures and level :math:`2` has :math:`K_{2}` failures
such that affected failure domains from the second level are not
children of affected failure domains from the first level, then it
implies that we have more than :math:`K` failures in at least one parity
group. Now suppose we have :math:`\ i_{1}\  < \ K_{1}` failures at the
first level and :math:`\ i_{2}\  < \ K_{2}\ ` failures at the second
level. How would we know if these failures are tolerable ? In this
section we characterize the region of all tolerable failure vectors (a
term that will be soon defined). It turns out that this region is a
convex polytope.

**Notations:**

Let the height of failure domains tree be :math:`D`. Consider a
vector-space :math:`\mathfrak{R}^{D}` over the field of real numbers
:math:`\mathfrak{R}`, each dimension of which we map to one failure
domain level. Let :math:`K_{l}` represent the maximum tolerable failures
at level :math:`l`.

**Def:** A *failure vector* :math:`\  \in` :math:`\mathfrak{R}^{D}` is a
vector, :math:`l^{th}` component of which represents the failures
encountered at level :math:`l`.

**Def:** A failure vector is said to be *tolerable* if maximum number of
failures caused by it in any parity group is not more than :math:`K`.

**Assumption A\ 1**:

Though it is not possible to support fractional failures we assume its
feasibility in following section, as it helps in visualizing the locus
of tolerable failure vectors.

**Claim 3**: Under the assumption **A\ 1**, the set of all tolerable
failure vectors is convex.

**Proof**:

Let :math:`\Lambda^{*}`\ denote the set of all tolerable failure
vectors. If :math:`\  \in \ \Lambda^{*}`, then for any
:math:`0\  < \ l\  \leq \ D`, let maximum failures caused by
:math:`v_{l}` in any parity group be :math:`k_{\text{vl}}`. Consider a
map,

:math:`s:\ \mathfrak{R}^{D}\mathfrak{\  \rightarrow \ R}`

:math:`\  \rightarrow \ \sum_{l\  = \ 1}^{D}{}k_{\text{vl}}`

It is clear that :math:`s` is linear (and hence convex). Then by
definition,

:math:`\Lambda^{*}\  = \ s^{- 1}(\ \lbrack 0,\ K\rbrack)`

Since the region :math:`\lbrack 0.\ K\rbrack` is convex, and
:math:`\Lambda^{*}` is a linear pre-image of it, :math:`\Lambda^{*}` is
convex.

It is clear that not all members of :math:`\Lambda^{*}`\ are practically
tolerable as we can not deal with fractional failures. But all tolerable
failure vectors, that do not represent fractional failures will always
be members of :math:`\Lambda^{*}`. A convex region is characterized by
its extreme points. The next claim helps in establishing at least
:math:`D` extreme points of :math:`\Lambda^{*}`.

**Def:** A vector :math:`\  \in` :math:`\mathfrak{R}^{D}` is called an
*extreme vector* if there exists :math:`1\  \leq l \leq D` such that:

:math:`e_{i}\ \  = \ K_{l}`, if :math:`i\  = \ l`,

   :math:`e_{i}\  = \ 0`, otherwise.

We represent an extreme vector having non-zero component in
:math:`i^{th}` direction as :math:``.

**Claim 4:** Let :math:`\  \in` :math:`\mathfrak{R}^{D}` be an input
failure vector. Let :math:`\Lambda` represent the convex polytope formed
using extreme vectors :math:``, :math:``, …, :math:``. If
:math:`\ \  \in \Lambda`, then it is tolerable.

**Proof:**

Let :math:`\lambda_{i\ }`\ ’s be the non-negative scalars such that,

   :math:`\  = \ \sum_{i\  = \ 1}^{D}{}\lambda_{i}`.

The maximum possible failures at the level of a parity group that this
vector could cause are: :math:`\sum_{i\  = \ 1}^{D}{}\lambda_{i}K`,
because maximum possible failures any :math:`` would cause are
:math:`K`.

Since :math:`` is contained in the convex polytope of :math:``\ ’s,
:math:`\sum_{i\  = \ 1}^{D}{}\lambda_{i}\  \leq 1`. Hence total failures
in any parity group can not be more than :math:`K` units.

It is worth noting that the condition above though sufficient, is not
necessary for a failure vector to be tolerable. Eg. suppose
:math:`N\  = \ 8`, :math:`K\  = \ 5`, and :math:`S\  = \ 5`. Assume that
a pool has :math:`9` racks. Thus using the uniform partitioning, each
rack would receive :math:`2` units from a parity group, and so maximum
tolerable failures at the level of racks is :math:`K_{1}\  = \ 2`. Thus
:math:`K_{1}` failures at the level of racks still leaves some room for
more failures at other levels, that could be tolerated. Thus one can see
that :math:`\Lambda\  \subseteq \ \Lambda^{*}`. Fig. 5 helps in
visualising this fact. If for each level :math:`l`, failure of
:math:`K_{l}` failure domains leads to *exactly* :math:`K` failures in
at least one parity group (and of course :math:`K` or lesser failures in
other parity groups), then :math:`\Lambda = \Lambda^{*}`, and the
condition from Claim 4 becomes sufficient as well as necessary.

A convex polytope is an intersection of closed half-spaces. A closed
half-space can be represented by an inequality of the form [5]:

:math:`a_{11}\text{.\ }v_{1}\  + \ a_{12}.{\ v}_{2}\  + \ ...\  + \ a_{1n}\text{.\ }v_{n}\  \leq \ b_{1}`

An intersection of :math:`m` such closed half-spaces can be represented
by a matrix inequality:

:math:`A\text{.\ }\  \leq \ `

where :math:`A` is an :math:`m\  \times \ n` matrix and :math:`` is an
:math:`m`-vector.

Once all :math:`K_{l}`\ ’s are known, we can compute and store
:math:`A`, and :math:`` for :math:`\Lambda`. Thus, determining the
feasibility of tolerating input failures reduces to a matrix-vector
multiplication.
